  <h4 class="container-lg text-center text-capitalize" id="compatibility">Browser Compatibility<br><br></h4>
  <p> It is recommended to use this app on a desktop/laptop instead of on mobile! </p> 
  <p> The app has been tested on recent versions of Google Chrome, Safari and Microsoft Edge. 
    Internet Explorer is <em>not</em> fully compatible. Since this is a client-side app (It is run entirely by your browser,
    no data is sent back the server for processing !), some essential functions may not
    work if your browser hasn't been updated for a long while, or your device places many
    restrictions on it.</p> <p>Javascript <b><i>must</i></b> be enabled for this site. In additon, it is recommended
  that atleast 10 MB memory is available (or don't upload too many images into one pack).</p>
    <p>This site does not use any cookies or local storage.</p>
  <h4 class="container-lg text-center text-capitalize" id="web-app"><br>Miscellaneous notes<br><br></h4>
  <ul class="mt-1">
    <li> When you create the add-on, commands to build all the images that were uploaded <i>and</i> processed
      will be written into it. Even a single map contains 128&times;128 = 16384 visible blocks to be placed (which is a 
      lot !), so the commands are split into 2 sets per map and written into seperate function files (they are
      regular commands like <code>/setblock</code>, but Minecraft can then execute upto 10,000 (by default) of them 
      <em>at once</em> from these files). More instructions on running the functions are given <a href="#in-mc">below</a>.
      <br><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Function_(Bedrock_Edition)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">
      Read more</a> about functions in Minecraft.</li><br>
    <li> The converted images seen after you click the 'Process Image' button may vary slightly (especially in the "noise"
      generated due to Image Dithering) depending on your device / browser (Since part of the image resizing operations are
      performed by your browser). This is unavoidable. </li><br>
    <li> The commands use relative <b>&tilde;</b> (<a  rel="nofollow noreferrer"
      href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands#Relative_world_coordinates:_Tilde_notation">tilde notation</a>) to
    specify the positon, so that the image can be built wherever you (the player, or a command block if you are using
    one) are located in your world when starting, instead of a specific area every time.</li><br>
    <li>For the 3D arrangement, the max height specification only ensures that blocks do not get
    placed <i>beyond</i> that height, but the limit may not be reached at all - it depends on the colours in the
    image. You may find, after building it, that the blocks did not reach that height anyway. <br> The limit does not 
    majorly affect the final appearance. (The shade of each block depends on the height difference between it and the block
    immediately North of it. This is usually 2 blocks, but may have to abruptly change near the height limit. For this reason,
    it is recommended not to keep a very low limit.)</li><br>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="container-lg text-center text-capitalize" id="in-mc"><br><br>In Minecraft<br><br></h4>
  <ol class="spaced-list">
    <li> Import and apply the behaviour pack to your world(s). <br> <strong class="text-muted">Note : </strong >Cheats &amp;
      Operator permissions must be enabled to use functions. If you want to earn achievements in that world or keep cheats 
      off, you'll have to place the blocks manually (You can look at the Survival Guide for some help).</li>
    <li> Go to the location where the image is to be built, and open a Level 0 (smallest size) map there. Check that the
      starting block you choose is aligned with the top-left (NW) corner of the map !<br>
      This block will be the top left (North-West) corner of the entire image (see the green marker in the figure below), 
      which will extend South and East from here. <br> Height-wise, it will be built at the block in which you are standing (2D),
      or for the 3D palette, extending from this height till [<i>specified height range</i>] blocks upwards
      (Also check that this doesn't cross the world build height !).</li>
    <li> <div class="row"><div class="col-md-8">If your image covers an area of <b><i>a</i></b>x<b><i>b</i></b>
      maps, there will be <code>2 * <b><i>a</i></b> * <b><i>b</i></b></code> commands to be executed in order,
      numbered <i>image_name</i>/<b>1</b>, <i>image_name</i>/<b>2</b>, ... so on.
      Each of these builds a part of the image, covering a vertical half of one map, arranged in order as illustrated
      in the figure alongside.<br>
      <ul><li class="py-2">If '<i class="text-monospace">Use same starting coordinates</i>' was enabled during pack creation, 
        you must run all the commands while staying at this same corner only (top-left of the whole image).</li>
      <li> Otherwise, running each function will teleport you (the nearest player) to the corner of the next zone 
        (marked by small black squares in the figure) after placing those blocks, so that you "move along" as you're running
        the functions one-by-one. A glowstone block may also be placed there to identify the corner - you must be standing 
        <em>exactly on top</em> of it before continuing with the next one.</li></ul></div>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Example arrangement for an art covering 2x2 maps.</figcaption></figure></div>
      </div></li>
    <li>The syntax of the function command is <kbd>/function&nbsp;<i>image_name</i>/<i>number</i></kbd>.<br>
    For example, if your image's name was <i>wallpaper</i>, and its size was 2x1 maps, you would need to run
      the commands <pre class="pl-4 mb-0"><code>/function wallpaper/1
/function wallpaper/2
/function wallpaper/3
/function wallpaper/4</code></pre><br>
    <strong class="text-muted">Note :</strong> You may need to restart Minecraft and run the <kbd>/reload</kbd> command first,
      in case they don't appear in the commands screen or minecraft hasn't recognised the functions <br> &nbsp;</li>
    <li><span class="lead">You're Done !</span><p> Once you've constructed the image, map the entire area covered by it
      and build a map wall for your pixel art !<br> It's also a good idea to <a rel="nofollow noreferrer"
      href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Cartography_Table#Usage" >lock the maps</a> with glass panes to prevent them
      from updating if some other structures are built above them, or if the colour palette changes in future updates.</p>

        <li> Behaviour pack version - <code>1.0.0</code> is used for each pack by default</li>

  <p>The pack contains some structures (with block data) of a few blocks that may decay or need support (non-solid blocks)
